# ``misc`` Mod
This mod has several miscelaneous mods that are too small to be their own mod, including:
- Rendering text above the hotbar when an item is selected.
- Sanitizing player usernames for invalid characters.
- Removing the red background from unobtainable items in the inventory.
- Loading the bundled language file.
- Optionally expanding the Creative Inventory.
- Printing chat messages to the log.
- Adding death messages.
